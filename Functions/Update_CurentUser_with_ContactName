	In Customer Asset, the primary contact of the deal is present as contact name . We are mapping that field with current User field.

record = zoho.crm.getRecordById("Assets",asset_id);
//Getting the Asset records
contactName = record.get("Contact_Name");
//Getting the contact name from that record
updateData = Map();
updateData.put("Current_User",contactName);
//putting the contact name in current user
updateResponse = zoho.crm.updateRecord("Assets",record.get("id"),updateData);
//updating the record
